# This session will treat data types in python

# Strings:
# These are characters in "" or ''

# Subscripting of Strings

# These are members of Z

# Floats:
# These are numbers in R. All decimals are called floats

# Boolean
# This consists of True or False

# Conversation of Data Types

num_1 = 333

# len(num1) This code will give a type error since, num1 is not a string

num_1 = str(num_1)
print(len(num_1))

# input function takes its input as strings
# you can convert into strings, float and int interchangeably

# You can do some basic arithmetic  you can do with floats and integers
# a + b  sum
# a - b  subtractions
# a /b   division
# a* b  multiplication
# a**b a power b
