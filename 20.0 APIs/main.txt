Application Programming Interfaces(APIs)

I see them as a middle man between your application and external application, if the rule is followed
you will be able to get your data.

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications.
It provides a standardized way for different software systems to interact and exchange information with each other.
APIs define the rules and formats that must be followed to make requests and receive responses between software components
or applications. APIs can be used to access and manipulate data, perform actions, and integrate with third-party systems,
among other things. They are commonly used in web development, mobile applications, and other software projects to enable
communication and integration between different systems.



API Endpoint:
    This is the location where the data is. For example the api where crypto data is stored is api.coinbase.com

API Request:
    This is the protocol required to exchange data.
