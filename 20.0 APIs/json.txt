Reading JSON in Python
To read JSON data from a file, you can use the json module's load() function. Here is an example:


import json

# Open the file containing the JSON data

with open('data.json', 'r') as f:
    # Load the JSON data from the file
    data = json.load(f)

# Access the JSON data
print(data)
In the above code, data.json is the file name that contains the JSON data. The with statement ensures that the file is closed after the data is loaded.

Writing JSON in Python
To write JSON data to a file, you can use the json module's dump() function. Here is an example:


import json

# JSON data to be written to file
data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

# Open a file for writing
with open('data.json', 'w') as f:
    # Write the JSON data to the file
    json.dump(data, f)
In the above code, data.json is the file name to which the JSON data is written.

Appending JSON in Python
To append JSON data to an existing file, you can first read the data from the file, update it, and then write it back to the file. Here is an example:



import json

# Open the file containing the JSON data
with open('data.json', 'r') as f:
    # Load the JSON data from the file
    data = json.load(f)

# Update the JSON data
data['city'] = 'Chicago'

# Open the file for writing (append mode)
with open('data.json', 'a') as f:
    # Write the updated JSON data to the file
    json.dump(data, f)
In the above code, data.json is the file name to which the JSON data is appended. Note that we open the file in append mode using the 'a' flag.

Updating JSON in Python
To update an existing JSON file, you can first read the data from the file, modify it, and then write it back to the file. Here is an example:


import json

# Open the file containing the JSON data
with open('data.json', 'r') as f:
    # Load the JSON data from the file
    data = json.load(f)

# Update the JSON data
data['city'] = 'Chicago'

# Open the file for writing (overwrite mode)
with open('data.json', 'w') as f:
    # Write the updated JSON data to the file
    json.dump(data, f)
In the above code, data.json is the file name to which the JSON data is updated. Note that we open the file in overwrite mode using the 'w' flag.
